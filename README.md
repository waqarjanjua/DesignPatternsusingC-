# DesignPatternsusingC#

This project will have explanation about SOLID principle using simple examples.
S -> Single Responsibility Principle: It states class should have only one primary responsibility.
O -> Open and Close Principle: It says class should not be open for modification but avaiable for extension, it means that addition of new functionality did not alter existing functionality.
L -> Liskov Substitution Principle: When we implement inheritance and use parent child relation ship, this principle states in such scenario if we assign child reference to parent then this does not alter values of individual objects.
I -> Interfae Segregation Principle: It states to keep interfaces simple instead of making them multifunctional as there will be scenarios in which customer does not need all functionality so istead of provding all functionality mandaotry we should impelement interefaces whenever required.
D -> Dependency Inversion Principle: IT emphasizes decoupling and abstraction. The principle consists of two core concepts: high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules, and both should depend on abstractions. This inverted dependency relationship promotes flexibility, testability, and maintainability.
